The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more
productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and
networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular
program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the
convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a
fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed,
interpreted language.

The tools are added to the path by putting go.sh and go.csh files in
/etc/profile.d and letting the system's /etc/profile or /etc/csh.login pick it
up.  If you want to add any of Go's environment variables you can add them
there.
